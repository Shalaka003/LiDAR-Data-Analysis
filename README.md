# LiDAR-Data-Analysis
Title: LiDAR Data Analysis. 
LiDAR data is obtained and a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) is created. 
As an application of these DEMs, we obtained 3 DEM sources of a glaciar with data points collected in 1970, 2005, 2015 and compared the elevation difference between them.
The results confirming that the elevation has decreased over time, i.e. the glaciers are melting.
